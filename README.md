# Obsidian Memos

A new way for you to quick capture idea in Obsidian. Which is highly based on awesome open project: [memos](https://github.com/justmemos/memos), and design styles(1.0) comes from [flomo](https://flomoapp.com/).

## Features

### Nice feature

1. All the memos comes from your daily notes, so you should open Daily Notes Plugin to make the plugin works.
2. And all memos are comes from a header you set( like `# Journal` ) in daily notes.
3. When you create a query, a query.md file will be generated automatically in your daily note folder.
4. When you delete a memo, it will send to the delete.md in your daily note folder, please don't edit it directly.
